in mind that for small lists, listinsert works faster, but for larger lists, inserting using slice notation becomes faster\\nDont prepend to lists\\nLists were meant to be appended to, not prepended to If you have a situation where this kind of prepending is a hurting the performace of your code, either switch to a deque or, if you can reverse your semantics and accomplish the same goal, reverse your list and append instead\\nIn general, avoid prepending to the builtin Python list object If someone finds this question like me, here are my performance tests of proposed methods\\nPython

assignment are as almost twice as fast than explicit adding and are very close in results As Raymond Hettinger noted insert is more common option and I, personally prefer this way to prepend to list In my opinion, the most elegant and idiomatic way of prepending an element or list to another list, in Python, is using the expansion operator  also called unpacking operator,\\n Initial list\\nl  , ,

time to consider using a collectionsdeque instead of a list Why is this?', 'Yes They are semantically different  the first one creates two new lists and throws away the short one with just x, and the second mutates the original list, in place In terms of computation, I would expect similar performance for the semantically similar parts  and a larger performance hit on the first for the allocation of space for the new lists I am usually able to avoid problems with mutability by only appending to lists And if I need a generic algorithm for example, from Haskell that mutates on the beginning of a list, I might reverse it to work from the end yourlistinsert, x has to move every element of yourlist up one position, essentially making the same copy that x  yourlist has to make Dakkaron I think youre wrong about that Quite a few sources cite linear complexity for listinsert, eg this nice table, and implied by the reasonable explanation the questioner linked to I suspect CPython is reallocating each element in memory in the list in the first two cases, so all three of these probably have linear complexity I havent actually looked at the code or tested it myself though, so sorry if those sources are wrong Collectionsdequeappendleft does have the linear complexity youre talking about Dakkaron not true, all of these have equivalent complexity Although insert and    work inplace, they still have to reallocate the entire buffer These benchmarks are bad The initial list should be created in separate setup step, not part of the timing itself And the last creates a new list  long, so comparing with the other two mutating inplace versions is apples and oranges did you fix your tests?', 'CharlieParker Yes, creating a new list would be less efficient because the all of the object reference counts would have to be updated Otherwise, the copying workload is similar As you observe, that isnt prepending to a list Its creating a new list Thus it doesnt satisfy the question at all While it doesnt satisfy the question, it rounds it out, and that is the purpose of this website Appreciate the comment and you are right, but when people search for this, its helpful to see this Also, if you want to prepend a list to a list then using insert wont work as expected but this method does!', 'The sinsert, x form is the most common\\nWhenever you see it though, it may

Doesnt work for unevenly nested lists like , , , , ,  juanpaarrivillaga its a simple and natural extension of the question, though Answers that can handle greater depth of nesting are more likely to be useful to someone who finds this question If you are still interested in Python  compatibility, change yield from to a for loop, eg for x in flatteni yield x Fails for python for the example nested list in the question , , , , , , , ,  Why extendl instead of appendl? number of arrays by average size of array? Sara can you define huge please? Tried numpyflat on the test example from Rossetta Code link and got VisibleDeprecationWarning Creating an ndarray from ragged nested sequences which is a listortuple of listsortuplesor ndarrays with different lengths or shapes is deprecated If you meant to do this, you must specify dtypeobject when creating the ndarray One option missed above which shows up faster for my particular case i just items  ; for sublist in a itemsextendsublist; return sublist This is a Shlemiel the painters algorithm joelonsoftwarecomarticlesfoghtml reduce is very inefficient for this use case as it will repeat copies and generate many unused temporary lists On in both time and possibly space, depending on how the GC decides to clean Its better to use append or extend I just wrote pretty much the same, because I didnt see your solution  here is what I looked for recursively flatten complete multiple lists   MartinThoma Much appreciated FYI, if flattening nested iterables is a common practice for you, there are some thirdparty packages that handle this well This may save from reinventing the wheel Ive mentioned moreitertools among others discussed in this post Cheers Maybe traverse could also be a good name for this way of a tree, whereas Id keep it less universal for this answer by sticking to nested lists You can check if hasattrx, iter instead of importingchecking against Iterable and that will exclude strings as well the above code doesnt seem to work for if one of the nested lists is having a list of strings , , , , , , , , ssssss, str, sss, ss, , ,  output , , , , , , , ssssss, , ,  OP doesnt mention they want to use numpy Python has good ways of doing this without relying on a library If you can afford adding a package to your project  this answer is best it fails when all elements are not list eg lst, , of course integer is not iterable also, mind that list of strings will be flattened to a list of characters extend is better used as newlist  , extend  newlistextend, for sublist in l extendl as it avoids the rather large overhead of the lambda, the attribute lookup on x, and the or for python  add from functools import reduce This answer is already up in this question stackoverflowcoma Neat! now your solution is inefficient And with any sequence, sumflattene for e in itr, tuple is highly inefficient, juanpaarrivillaga Your comment made me think about improving my answer and I think I found a better one, what do you think? Though the other answer here, stackoverflowcoma, explains the reasons this solution should generally be avoided its inefficient and confusing Will also give a TypeError if your list contains a tuple why would you use a tuple?\n"
