Doesnt work for unevenly nested lists like , , , , ,  juanpaarrivillaga its a simple and natural extension of the question, though Answers that can handle greater depth of nesting are more likely to be useful to someone who finds this question If you are still interested in Python  compatibility, change yield from to a for loop, eg for x in flatteni yield x Fails for python for the example nested list in the question , , , , , , , ,  Why extendl instead of appendl? number of arrays by average size of array? Sara can you define huge please? Tried numpyflat on the test example from Rossetta Code link and got VisibleDeprecationWarning Creating an ndarray from ragged nested sequences which is a listortuple of listsortuplesor ndarrays with different lengths or shapes is deprecated If you meant to do this, you must specify dtypeobject when creating the ndarray One option missed above which shows up faster for my particular case i just items  ; for sublist in a itemsextendsublist; return sublist This is a Shlemiel the painters algorithm joelonsoftwarecomarticlesfoghtml reduce is very inefficient for this use case as it will repeat copies and generate many unused temporary lists On in both time and possibly space, depending on how the GC decides to clean Its better to use append or extend I just wrote pretty much the same, because I didnt see your solution  here is what I looked for recursively flatten complete multiple lists   MartinThoma Much appreciated FYI, if flattening nested iterables is a common practice for you, there are some thirdparty packages that handle this well This may save from reinventing the wheel Ive mentioned moreitertools among others discussed in this post Cheers Maybe traverse could also be a good name for this way of a tree, whereas Id keep it less universal for this answer by sticking to nested lists You can check if hasattrx, iter instead of importingchecking against Iterable and that will exclude strings as well the above code doesnt seem to work for if one of the nested lists is having a list of strings , , , , , , , , ssssss, str, sss, ss, , ,  output , , , , , , , ssssss, , ,  OP doesnt mention they want to use numpy Python has good ways of doing this without relying on a library If you can afford adding a package to your project  this answer is best it fails when all elements are not list eg lst, , of course integer is not iterable also, mind that list of strings will be flattened to a list of characters extend is better used as newlist  , extend  newlistextend, for sublist in l extendl as it avoids the rather large overhead of the lambda, the attribute lookup on x, and the or for python  add from functools import reduce This answer is already up in this question stackoverflowcoma Neat! now your solution is inefficient And with any sequence, sumflattene for e in itr, tuple is highly inefficient, juanpaarrivillaga Your comment made me think about improving my answer and I think I found a better one, what do you think? Though the other answer here, stackoverflowcoma, explains the reasons this solution should generally be avoided its inefficient and confusing Will also give a TypeError if your list contains a tuple why would you use a tuple?\n"
