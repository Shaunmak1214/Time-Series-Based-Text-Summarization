I'd like to start by expressing my deepest appreciation to Dr. Goh Hui Ngo, my supervisor, for all of her help during this research, her patience, and her extensive expertise.

Additionally, I'd want to express my gratitude to those who have always encouraged and supported me during this endeavour, particularly my family and friends.
