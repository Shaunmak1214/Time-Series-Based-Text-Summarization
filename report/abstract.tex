Finding answers from forums has been one of the most time consuming and tedious tasks for many people. This is because the answers are scattered across the forums and it is very hard to find the relevant answers. This problem particularly shows it's face when it comes to software engineering. About 50 percent of searches don't provide enough results, according to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. This is especially true in software engineering, where it can be very challenging to zero down on the exact correct solution that solves your problem in such a sophisticated domain. Automatic FAQ Generation, Question Generation, and Answer Retrieval techniques arose over time, however most studies concentrated on broad topics like banking, healthcare, and so on. Therefore, in this work, we attempt to build upon prior research and transfer tried-and-true methods from other fields into the software engineering sphere.
