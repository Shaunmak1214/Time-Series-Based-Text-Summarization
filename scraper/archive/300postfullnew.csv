Tim Dierks,"The * is the tricky thing that makes chain less straightforward than the list comprehension. You have to know that chain only joins together the iterables passed as parameters, and the * causes the top-level list to be expanded into parameters, so chain joins together all those iterables, but doesn't descend further.

Tim Dierks,"The * is the tricky thing that makes chain less straightforward than the list comprehension. You have to know that chain only joins together the iterables passed as parameters, and the * causes the top-level list to be expanded into parameters, so chain joins together all those iterables, but doesn't descend further.

jjramsey,"I see two other problems: First, you never initialize b. Second, there's no point in setting sum = a[i]. You not only set sum to zero right after that, but you also set it to zero for every iteration of your inner for loop, which is redundant.

CAdaker,"Technically, it's still correct. [4]*3 is essentially equivalent to x = 4; [x, x, x]. It's true, though, that this will never cause any problem since 4 is immutable. Also, your other example isn't really a different case. a = [x]*3; a[0] = 5 won't cause problems even if x is mutable, since you're not modifying x, only modifying a. I wouldn't describe my answer as misleading or incorrect - you just can't shoot yourself in the foot if you're dealing with immutable objects.","May 22, 2015 at 8:04",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72751089/python-list-behavior-changes-when-using-list-comprehension-vs-using-the-operat,List of lists changes reflected across sublists unexpectedly,answer

Gino Mempin,"Related note on for keeping an index from the Python docs docs.python.org/3.9/reference/…: ""There is a subtlety when the sequence is being modified by the loop (this can only occur for mutable sequences, e.g. lists). An internal counter is used to keep track of which item is used next, and this is incremented on each iteration. ... This means that if the suite deletes the current (or a previous) item from the sequence, the next item will be skipped (since it gets the index of the current item which has already been treated).""",Jan 31 at 4:03,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72166710/enumerate-result-in-python-list,Strange result when removing item from a list while iterating over it,answer
